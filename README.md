This repository provides a **trained aesthetic evaluation toolkit** based on [SongEval](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ASLP-lab/SongEval), the first large-scale, open-source dataset for human-perceived song aesthetics. The toolkit enables **automatic scoring of generated song** across five perceptual aesthetic dimensions aligned with professional musician judgments.
